# Exploring-EfficientWays-To-Capture-Air-in-a-Container-A-Localized-Study

Don’t take anything stated in this paper seriously. Thanks.

The introduction and background study section may contain plagiarism (I am pretty
sure about it, as I did not have much time to write the whole paper
on my own and I, myself had copied and pasted a bunch of texts
here. I am not gonna submit this paper anywhere anyways. So does
it matter?). 

Others parts starting from the methodology is written
by the first author, and reviewed by the second author. 

The ACM Reference Format on the first page is not correct. However, I kept
this as I was unable to remove it. The paper used the ACM SIGS
proceedings format to be used for the GE@ICSE’22 Workshop, that
is going to be held on Februray 2022, Pittsburgh, KS, USA. Could
not remove the text "GE@ICSE’22, Februray 2022, Pittsburgh, KS,
USA" from top of the pages of the paper as well, so kept it as it is.
